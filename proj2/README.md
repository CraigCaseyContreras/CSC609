This is the folder for the contents for project 2. The first program involved following question 2.8 from the cyrptography textbook. The second program involved modifiying a simplyfied version of enigma in order to gain an advantage. The full details of the programs are in the professor's website. This assignment involved collaborating with some of my classmates as it proved to be tough.
